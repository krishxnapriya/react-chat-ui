# React Chat UI Application

This is a basic chat room application built using CometChat Visual Builder integrated with React.js.

## Features

- Real-time chat with users.
- Group chat functionality.
- User authentication via CometChat SDK.
- Customizable UI components.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following:

- **CometChat Account**: Set up your CometChat app and obtain your `APP_ID`, `AUTH_KEY`, and `REGION`.
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.

## Pre-Setup Instructions: 

1. **Visit the CometChat Website**: Go to [CometChat](https://www.cometchat.com).
2. **Sign up with your work email**.
3. **Launch Visual Builder**:
   - Go to **Dashboard** > **Integrate** > Select the Framework (e.g., React) > **Launch Visual Builder**.
4. **Apply the desirable changes** in the Visual Builder.
5. **Download the ZIP file** after applying changes.

## Setup Instructions:

### Step 1: Visit the CometChat Website
Go to [CometChat](https://www.cometchat.com).

### Step 2: Navigate to the Documentation
- Go to **Developer** > **Integration** > **UI Kits** > **Documentation**.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies after creating your React app:

```bash
npm install @cometchat/chat-uikit-react@6.0.3 @cometchat/calls-sdk-javascript @cometchat/chat-sdk-javascript
```

### Step 4: Copy CometChat Folder
Copy the cometchat-visual-builder-react/src/CometChat folder into your project's src directory.

### Step 5: Initialize CometChat UI Kit
The initialization process varies depending on your setup. For Vite, use the following initialization:

```main.tsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App.tsx";
import {
  UIKitSettingsBuilder,
  CometChatUIKit,
} from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react";
import { setupLocalization } from "./CometChat/utils/utils.ts";
import { BuilderSettingsProvider } from "./CometChat/context/BuilderSettingsContext.tsx";

export const COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS = {
  APP_ID: "", // Replace with your App ID
  REGION: "", // Replace with your App Region
  AUTH_KEY: "", // Replace with your Auth Key or leave blank if you are authenticating using Auth Token
};

const uiKitSettings = new UIKitSettingsBuilder()
  .setAppId(COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS.APP_ID)
  .setRegion(COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS.REGION)
  .setAuthKey(COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS.AUTH_KEY)
  .subscribePresenceForAllUsers()
  .build();

CometChatUIKit.init(uiKitSettings)?.then(() => {
  setupLocalization();
  createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
    <BuilderSettingsProvider>
      <App />
    </BuilderSettingsProvider>
  );
});
```

### Step 6: Replace the Placeholders
Replace the following placeholders with your actual CometChat credentials:

- `APP_ID`: Your CometChat App ID.
- `REGION`: Your App Region.
- `AUTH_KEY`: Your CometChat Auth Key.

You can find these credentials on your CometChat Dashboard.

### Step 7: User Authentication
Authenticate a user by calling the login method with the UID (User ID):

```
const UID = "cometchat-uid-1"; // Replace with your UID
```
Use pre-generated test users:

- `cometchat-uid-1`
- `cometchat-uid-2`
- `cometchat-uid-3`
-  `cometchat-uid-4`
- `cometchat-uid-5`

You can find these credentials on your CometChat Dashboard.

### Step 8: Render the CometChatBuilderApp Component
Add the following code to render the CometChat Builder App component in your React app:

```app.tsx
import CometChatBuilderApp from "./CometChat/CometChatBuilderApp";

const App = () => {
   return (
     /* CometChatBuilderApp requires a parent with explicit height & width to render correctly. 
     Adjust the height and width as needed. */
    <div style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}>
      <CometChatBuilderApp />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Step 9: Run the Application
Start your application using:

-For Vite / Next.js:

```bash
npm run dev
```
-For Create React App (CRA):

```
npm start
```
## Challenges Faced

Initially faced an error while installing `@cometchat/chat-uikit-react` — the package wasn’t found in the public npm registry.

**Solution:** After checking the documentation, I used the correct scoped version available via:

```bash
npm install @cometchat/chat-uikit-react@6.0.3 @cometchat/calls-sdk-javascript @cometchat/chat-sdk-javascript
```

## Conclusion
Now our basic chat room application with CometChat is set up! We can start using it for real-time communication, group chats, and more. If you encounter any issues, make sure to check the documentation for troubleshooting tips.
